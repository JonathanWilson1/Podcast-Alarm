Thank you for choosing to be part of Podcast Alarm (“company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at jonathan@podcastalarm.app.

When you visit our app and website and use our services, you trust us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy notice, we describe our privacy policy. We seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it and what rights you have in relation to it. We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it is important. If there are any terms in this privacy policy that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our app and services.

This privacy policy applies to all information collected through our mobile application (“App”), website, and/or any related services, sales, marketing or events (we refer to them collectively in this privacy policy as the “Services”).

Please read this privacy policy carefully as it will help you make informed decisions about sharing your personal information with us.

1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

Information automatically collected

In Short: Some information — such as device characteristics and usage data — is collected automatically when you use our App.

We automatically collect certain information when you use our App. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your device type, operating system, language preferences, country, and information about how and when you use our App and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

We use Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics to collect anonymous usage and crash data to improve the App experience.

Payment Data

All purchases are processed through the Apple App Store. We do not directly collect or store any payment information. Please refer to Apple’s privacy policy for information on how your payment data is handled.

2. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

In Short: We process your information to provide, improve and administer our App, for analytics purposes, and to comply with law.

We use the information we collect or receive to:

- Provide and maintain our App
- Monitor and analyse usage trends to improve the App
- Diagnose crashes and technical issues
- Comply with legal obligations

3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?

In Short: We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.

We may share information in the following situations:

- With service providers: We share data with third-party service providers that help us operate the App, including Firebase (Google) for analytics and crash reporting.
- For legal reasons: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
- Business transfers: We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

4. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

Our App uses the following third-party services that may collect information:

- **Firebase Analytics** — anonymous usage analytics
- **Firebase Crashlytics** — crash reporting

These services are provided by Google. You can review Google’s privacy policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?

Our mobile App does not use cookies. Our website (podcastalarm.app) may use cookies and similar tracking technologies for analytics purposes. You can control cookies through your browser settings.

6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through appropriate technical and organisational security measures.

We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.

8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?

In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 13 years of age.

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 13 years of age. By using the App, you represent that you are at least 13 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the App. If we learn that personal information from users less than 13 years of age has been collected, we will take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.

9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?

In Short: Depending on your region, you may have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information.

**European Economic Area (EEA) and UK residents:** Under the GDPR and UK GDPR, you have the right to (i) request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) request rectification or erasure, (iii) restrict the processing of your personal information, and (iv) if applicable, data portability. You may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To exercise these rights, contact us at jonathan@podcastalarm.app.

If you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.

10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?

In Short: Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Last updated” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
