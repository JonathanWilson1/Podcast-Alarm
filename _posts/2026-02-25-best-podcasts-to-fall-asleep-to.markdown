<p>If your brain won't switch off at bedtime, a sleep podcast can work wonders. These shows use calming voices, gentle stories and ambient sounds to help you drift off naturally — no meditation experience required.</p>

<h3>1. Sleep With Me</h3>
<p>The original sleep podcast. Host Drew Ackerman tells long, meandering, deliberately boring bedtime stories in a soothing monotone. It sounds strange, but it works — the stories are just interesting enough to distract your racing mind, but too dull to keep you awake. Over a billion downloads and counting.</p>

<h3>2. Nothing Much Happens</h3>
<p>Kathryn Nicolai reads original bedtime stories for adults. Each episode paints a cosy scene — walking through autumn leaves, sitting by a fire, wandering through a quiet village — and then reads it twice, more slowly the second time. The effect is genuinely hypnotic.</p>

<h3>3. Get Sleepy</h3>
<p>A mix of guided meditation and sleep stories, Get Sleepy starts each episode with a short wind-down before easing into a calming narrative. The production quality is excellent, with subtle ambient sounds layered beneath the narration. New episodes three times a week.</p>

<h3>4. Slow Radio — BBC</h3>
<p>No narration, no music — just real-world sounds. Dawn birdsong in a Scottish forest. Rain on a tin roof. Waves on a Cornish beach. The BBC captures natural soundscapes from around the world, and the result is deeply relaxing. Perfect if voices keep you awake.</p>

<h3>5. The Moth</h3>
<p>Real people telling true stories on stage, The Moth isn't designed as a sleep podcast — but its warm, conversational storytelling makes it perfect for winding down. The stories are engaging enough to stop you doomscrolling, but gentle enough to let you drift off.</p>

<h3>6. Boring Books for Bedtime</h3>
<p>Exactly what it sounds like. Public domain texts read in a calm, steady voice — think Victorian gardening manuals, old geography textbooks, and forgotten etiquette guides. The content is wonderfully dull, and that's the whole point.</p>

<h3>7. Deep Energy</h3>
<p>Ambient electronic music designed for sleep, meditation, and deep relaxation. No words, no stories — just long, flowing soundscapes that last 1–2 hours. If you want something playing in the background all night, this is ideal.</p>
