<p>True crime is the most popular podcast genre in the world, and for good reason — a gripping investigation is impossible to stop listening to. Here are 8 of the best.</p>

{% include callToActionRow.html %}

<br>

<h3>1. Serial</h3>
<p>The one that started it all. Season one investigated the 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee and became the fastest podcast to reach 5 million downloads. Each season tackles a different case with the depth and storytelling of a great novel. If you haven't listened yet, start here.</p>

<h3>2. Crime Junkie</h3>
<p>Hosted by Ashley Flowers and Brit Prawat, Crime Junkie is the number two podcast in the US with over 3 billion downloads. Every Monday, they cover a new case in a tight, well-researched 30–45 minute episode. The format is consistent and addictive — perfect for a weekly listen.</p>

<h3>3. Casefile True Crime</h3>
<p>An Australian podcast with an anonymous host, Casefile stands out for its meticulous research and respectful treatment of victims. It covers international cases that other podcasts miss, with episodes ranging from 30 minutes to multi-part deep dives.</p>

<h3>4. My Favorite Murder</h3>
<p>Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark blend true crime with comedy in a way that shouldn't work but absolutely does. Their conversational style and genuine friendship make heavy topics more approachable. The show has spawned live tours, books, and an entire podcast network.</p>

<h3>5. Somebody Knows Something</h3>
<p>CBC journalist David Ridgen reopens cold cases and actually makes progress on them. This is investigative journalism at its best — Ridgen has helped lead to real-world breakthroughs in unsolved cases. Each season follows one story with remarkable depth.</p>

<h3>6. In the Dark</h3>
<p>Award-winning investigative journalism from APM Reports. Season two, which covers the case of Curtis Flowers, is widely considered one of the best podcast seasons ever made. It exposed serious problems in the American justice system and contributed to real legal outcomes.</p>

<h3>7. Undisclosed</h3>
<p>A deep dive into wrongful convictions, Undisclosed examines cases where the evidence doesn't add up. Hosted by attorneys, it brings legal expertise to cases that deserve a second look. If you finished Serial wanting more, this is your next listen.</p>

<h3>8. RedHanded</h3>
<p>British hosts Suruthi Bala and Hannah Maguire cover true crime from around the world with sharp analysis and dark humour. Their UK perspective sets them apart from the American-dominated true crime scene, and they consistently tackle lesser-known international cases.</p>
